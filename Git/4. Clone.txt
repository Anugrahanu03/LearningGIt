***Clone***

This enables us to work on the same repo from a diff machine or other people to work on the same repo

This way, we can see all the commits/branches and people who have worked on that repo

1. Copy .git url from the repository

2. In cmd go to the directory where you want to clone the repo

3. git clone <RemoteUrl> --> it will create a new folder with the repo name

4. cd <FolderName> --> to change dir to that folder

5. dir --> to see all the files in the folder

6. git log --> to see all the commits 

7. git remote --> to see the remote
